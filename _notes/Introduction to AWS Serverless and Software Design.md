title: Workshop: Introduction to AWS Serverless and Software Design
---

## Overview
On 5 September 2020, I had the pleasure to introduce serverless technologies to hackathon participants from the [Ellipsis SMU Information Systems Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ellipsis-smu-computing-and-information-systems-society/) Tech Series Hackathon co-organised by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-web-services/). 

## Content
- 1) Introduction to Serverless
- 2) AWS Serverless Services
- 3) Serverless Best Practices
- 4) Case study of [Realtor.com](http://realtor.com/)  
- 5) Hands-on project where we deployed WildRydes - a serverless web application from scratch!  

In the 2-hours session, we built a ride-hailing web application using serverless architecture with AWS services ranging from AWS CodeCommit, Amplify, Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda, to API Gateway.

p.s. Thank you so much to [#AWSEducate](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=awseducate&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6707852641642397696) and Singapore Management University Ellipsis for having me, I've learnt so much about serverless myself while preparing for the workshop.
