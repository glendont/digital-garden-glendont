Hey there! Iâ€™m Glendon, a current senior from the Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) based in Singapore. I enjoy building and breaking things, working with people, and exploring different realms of the human experience.


ðŸ¦„ Currently, I'm a Prototyping Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) building prototypes for the coolest startups across South East Asia.
